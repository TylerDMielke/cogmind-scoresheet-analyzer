# Cogmind Scoresheet Analyzer: To Do
Task list and possible feature ideas.

- [ ] Implement a way to store already read data
  - Why? Is that helpful?
  
- [ ] Implement a way to detect sections
  - Most "sections" come with a title and multiple hypens on the next line. This could be useful for navigating the raw
    score files.
